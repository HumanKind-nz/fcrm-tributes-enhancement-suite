Overrides specific dependencies in the FCRM Tributes plugin

Currently the FireHawk CRM Tributes WordPress plugin (as at v2.0.1.10) auto loads everything including the Flower Delivery features not used by some sites.
This plugin can be adapted to turn off the autolading of all the FireHawk plugin dependancies and files, unless they are needed.

FireHawk CRM and their WordPress tributes plugin are from [FireHawk Funerals](https://firehawkfunerals.com)
